      "3. **Slight upward movement in corn release price** – Corn release price stayed at **$3.15** for Level IV, with a call price of **$3.15**; Level V call price rose to **$3.25** by early April.  \n",
      "4. **Oats and barley modestly higher in early April** – Oats average rose from **$1.24** (Feb 26) to **$1.57‑$1.58** (early April). Barley, which was “n.a.” on Feb 26, appeared at **$1.49‑$1.55** in April.  \n",
      "5. **Sorghum loan rate and release price** – Sorghum’s loan rate is expressed as **$3.25 per CWT** (Y) and the release price stayed at **$5.36 per CWT** (Level IV) with a call price of **$5.54** for Level V.  \n",
      "6. **Reserve maturity** – All three original reserves (I, II, III) had matured by the time of these reports. The level definitions (IV, V, VI) are based on the date grain entered the reserve (e.g., Level IV = grain entered after 6 Oct 1981 for feedgrain, after 23 Jul 1981 for wheat; Level V = after 14 May 1982 for wheat/barley, after 1 Jul 1982 for corn/sorghum; Level VI = wheat entered after 19 Jan 1984).  \n",
